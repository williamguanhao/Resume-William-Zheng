William Zheng is obsessed with Data Science and Machine Learning. He firmly believes that Data Science and Machine Learning are the electricity of this generation, which will rebuild the world. Even though his major doesnâ€™t exactly match, he is willing to devote himself and exhaust all the resources to become a Data Scientist.

In Oct. 2020, he will further his study in the University of Sheffield major in Business Finance and Economics. To strength the knowledge in the field, he is currently studying FRM(Financial Risk Management).Ultimately his plan is to start a New Career from Data Analyst in Finance.
